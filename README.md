# Disease_prediction
This was a group project done by me and 3 other members of my class where we have created a demo application named Dtalk for predicting the possible disease using the symptoms of patient.
To use this project there is ML folder in Dtalk folder from there you can have our datasets or can use my trained model by using the pickle/tflite file uploaded 
Definitely worth a try ðŸ”¥ðŸ™Œ
